Summary

1.The demand increases in the summer months of June, July and August and it drops afterwards. It is possibly because of the school holiday. There is a spike in demand again in January probably due christmas-New Year's holiday. The demand again drops after that. The average price of a rental is generally reflects the demand vs supply trend of the availability. When the availability in the market is low, the price is relatively higher. When there is sufficient supply, the price is lower.

2.The top six reasons of determing the price is "accomodates, number of bedroom, number of beds, clearning fee, size of the room, bathroom". These reasons provide a convincible reference for host setting the price to attract more booking, in the meanwhile maxmise the largest benefit. The clearning fee is mainly relies on the amenities supplies such as "TV, AC, Kitchen, Washer / Dryer, Interne".

3.The largest number of reviews are applied on the properties of low-middle range of price. It follows with the reality that low-middle price properties attract more customers than the high price ones. Most properties provide only 1 bedroom. The most expensive area like Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay, Westlake in Seattle are all located near the water and close to the city centre.
